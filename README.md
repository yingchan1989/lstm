# Long Short Term Memory Cells for SPY Predictions and Trading Algorithm

This paper/code-base, split into a data preparation step written in R, and a machine learning step written in Python outlines data collection and preparation of market data, and the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural networks to predict SPY returns and hence develop a trading algorithm.
